// Package grocery provides helper functions for storing objects in Redis.
//
// This package adds helpful primitives on top of the popular go-redis
// framework to store and load structs with ease. Within these structs,
// Grocery provides built-in support for storing lists, sets, pointers to other
// structs, and other custom datatypes.
